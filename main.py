Developed by Parth Khanna, Student at GGSIPU, University School of Automation and Robotics

Early and accurate disease detection is crucial for healthy crops and a bountiful harvest. This Plant Disease Recognition System, developed by Parth Khanna, leverages the power of machine learning to help you identify plant diseases quickly and efficiently.

How it Works:

Upload: Simply upload an image of your plant.
Analyze: Our trained model analyzes the image for visual signs of disease.
Get Results: Receive a prediction of the potential disease affecting your plant.

                Why Choose This System?

User-Friendly: Designed for ease of use, even for those new to plant diagnostics.
Fast Results: Get predictions in seconds, enabling timely action.
Built with Cutting-Edge Technology: Powered by advanced machine learning algorithms for accurate identification.

                About the Developer:

Parth Khanna is a passionate student at GGSIPU's University School of Automation and Robotics, driven to apply his knowledge to solve real-world problems. This project reflects his commitment to using technology for a more sustainable future.


                Get Started:

                #### About Dataset
                This dataset is recreated using offline augmentation from the original dataset.The original dataset can be found on this github repo.
                This dataset consists of about 87K rgb images of healthy and diseased crop leaves which is categorized into 38 different classes.The total dataset is divided into 80/20 ratio of training and validation set preserving the directory structure.
                A new directory containing 33 test images is created later for prediction purpose.
                #### Content
                1. train (70295 images)
                2. test (33 images)
